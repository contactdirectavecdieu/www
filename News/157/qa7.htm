<p>Q: Although I meditate diligently, I’ve only seen the Light once. If I wish 
to see the Light, then I'm attached to an outcome. But if I don't wish to see 
the Light, does that mean I won’t progress spiritually? </p>
<p>M: No, you can wish to see the Light, but don’t demand it, saying, “I have to 
see it every day, I have to see it every time,” and so on. You’re doing very 
fine for a beginner. You're doing wonderfully. So just continue in a relaxed and 
loving manner. </p>
<p>All of us would like to see the Light every day. But we’ve been conditioned 
not to be able to see God. A lot of people out there believe in God, but if God 
appeared to them in any form, they’d be startled or wouldn’t believe it or think 
it was a devil's trick or an illusion. So since our youth, we’ve been 
conditioned and brainwashed into believing that we can’t see God or that God is 
something we can never touch. We know God is there, but we believe that no one 
is able to see Hirm. So, when we meditate now—even though at the time of 
initiation we got immediate enlightenment, a glimpse of God in the form of Light 
or Sound or even some physical manifestation in the inner vision so that we can 
connect with God in the way we expect to—our mind still battles all the time, 
thinking, “It's not real.” </p>
<p>And that’s the reason for our retarded progress. It's not that we aren’t 
diligent. It’s just that our brain has been too bombarded with fake, false, 
negative information. So now we have to do more meditation all the time in order 
to recondition our minds to accept it. And then the believing and non-believing 
energies won’t contradict each other so we’ll be more relaxed and enjoy visions 
of God more often. </p>

<h2><a name="qa2">Les attentes entravent le progrès spirituel</a> </h2>
<h3>Spoken by Supreme Master Ching Hai, Videoconference with initiates from San 
Francisco, California, Etats-Unis, August 25, 2002 (Originally in anglais) Videotape 
#748 </h3>
<p>Q: Is there no correlation between our spiritual level and the time we put 
into spiritual practice? Why don’t I experience the Light and Sound from a high 
spiritual level after having practiced for eleven years? Dear Master, would You 
please tell me what my problem is? Please advise me. Thank You, Master. </p>
<p>M: I think you’re expecting all the time; that's why. You interfere with your 
spiritual practice through your intellectual attitude of expectation. For 
example, “OK, if I meditate for one year, I should go to the first level; if I 
meditate for two years, I’ll go to the second level; if I meditate for three 
years, I’ll go to the third level,” etc. </p>
<p>It doesn’t work like that. God is not to be dictated to the way the mind 
wants. Because whatever you're thinking and comparing with right now is the mind 
working; it’s the working of the illusion of Maya, not the real God. So 
sometimes because you think too much with your mind, you hinder your own 
progress. </p>
<p>Just be like a child. Don’t calculate too much; don’t do it like a business, 
like, “OK, I’ve meditated for ten years so I should get this and that.” We’re 
not in something like an enterprise. We should just do it like a child without 
expecting anything. The parent will know how to reward us. </p>
<p>Relax, and then you’ll enjoy it more. (Applause) We’re so much in the habit 
of expecting things to go our way that in the family we ask the kids to do this 
and that according to our liking. And we ask our husband or wife to do this and 
that according to our opinion. And then we go outside and ask our friends and 
associates to do this and that according to our ideas. And if we’re supposed to 
be in a superior position, like a supervisor on the job, or a manager or a boss, 
then of course we’re used to telling everyone what to do. </p>
<p>And that's why we think spiritual practice should go the same way, but it 
doesn’t. As long as we still work with our brain, calculating and doing things 
like that, it will never work. So relax, be like a kid; don't look forward to 
what will happen next; just don't know. And then it will come. (Applause) Kids 
never know what’s happening next. Their parents arrange everything for them. </p>

<h2><a name="qa3">Recherchez d'abord la paix intérieure et la paix dans le monde suivra</a></h2>
<h3>Spoken by Supreme Master Ching Hai, Videoconference with initiates from San 
Francisco, California, Etats-Unis, August 25, 2002 (Originally in anglais) Videotape 
#748 </h3>
<p>Q: Master, on one occasion You said that we come here to bless and beautify 
the world. And on another occasion You mentioned that some of us come to this 
world to play an evil role for the purpose of knowing God. So my question is, as 
long as duality exists in this world, how can world peace be achieved? </p>
<p>M: I don't know. You ask for world peace. That’s a very difficult question, 
of course. The people who haven’t been enlightened and who still play evil or 
ignorant roles are like that. They’re playing that part. And the people who came 
to enlightenment immediately were born and searched all their lives; and they 
came to see a Master to get enlightenment. These people, like the Masters and 
their highly enlightened disciples, came purposely into this life to bless the 
world. </p>
<p>When I say “we,” I’d like to include myself with you and all the other 
Masters, enlightened beings, high level disciples and less high level disciples 
just because they aren’t yet very highly enlightened. I don't want to sit here 
and tell you, “Look, ‘I’ have come here to bless the world, and you’re unholy 
people,” or anything like that. So when I say we came here to play an evil role, 
I also include myself. And when I say we came here to bless the world, I also 
include myself because in the world of God, we’re all one. So if you’ve already 
become very highly enlightened in this lifetime, it means that maybe you took a 
vow in Heaven and came down here again for the purpose of blessing the world.
</p>
<p>So you came and got enlightened quickly, and other people who haven’t 
fulfilled their purposes yet still continue to wallow in ignorance because their 
role is not yet finished. Or that’s the vow they wanted to take. And because 
this world exists for that purpose, maybe world peace isn’t always complete. 
World peace exists within us, within saintly people all the time—within our 
group, for example. World peace doesn't have to be complete. World peace can be 
complete at one time or another, but because of the evolution of humankind, 
we’ll always have some friction between one group or another. And we’ll 
sometimes experience the peak of the Golden Age, and sometimes plunge down into 
a dark age again. This is the process of evolution. </p>
<p>We’re reaching world peace by being peaceful within ourselves and within our 
world, and because of that the world also benefits. And the other people who are 
still wallowing in ignorance will wake up due to our up-pulling energy. That's 
how we’re going to have world peace, maybe in the year 3000, maybe in another 
thousand years. Maybe we’ll have it one day, but then again we don't always have 
to have it. And even if we don't have complete world peace in every corner, we 
have world peace in some corners or in part of the world, or in two thirds of 
the world. And that’s already wonderful, don't you think? (Q: Yes.) </p>
<p>It’s better than hell, altogether better than hell. Actually, I’ll tell you 
the truth: World peace already exists. It’s just that people’s perceptions and 
concepts are different. For me, world peace exists. For you, world peace exists 
within you, in your family and your group. But many people in this world 
perceive it as hell. </p>
<p>Q: Yes. So we have to do our own part. </p>
<p>M: Yes, we do our own part. We each perceive the outside world differently 
according to our level. So some people are living in Heaven right now and others 
are living in hell right now in the same world. Some people have peace of mind 
in the same world and some people struggle every day with all kinds of negative 
thoughts in their heads. For these people, even if world peace exists, there are 
never any peaceful moments. </p>

<h2><a name="qa4">Le meilleur moyen de protéger la Terre est l'éveil spirituel de l'humanité</a></h2>
<h3>Spoken by Supreme Master Ching Hai, Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S.A., March 28, 
1993, (Originally in anglais) Videotape #343 </h3>
<p>Q: Dearest Master, some meditation practitioners claim they’ve seen a vision 
of a great disaster in which millions of people are killed. Master, is that 
real? </p>
<p>M: It will be real if many of our world’s residents don’t wake up and make 
use of our own great saving power inside. It will be real. God has given us a 
lifesaving power, but most of us don’t use it. Of course, everything that’s been 
created will be destroyed in the proper time. If we don’t have enough creative 
power to preserve it or restore it, then it will be destroyed. </p>
<p>Just like a house: It could be well-built but if we don’t maintain it, even 
if we have all the tools, all the paint and all the equipment to repair it, the 
house will come apart or become damaged by itself. Now, even if this does 
happen, we still have the emergency exits. But if we don’t know about them or if 
we don’t use them, of course we’ll be in danger. </p>
<p>So I’d like to offer you this opportunity to at least save yourself should it 
come to that. But how many people hear me? It’s so simple and unconditional. You 
sit there and relax, just like you’re sleeping, and then all the power, all the 
knowledge of your past and all the skills of life come to you. It’s so easy, but 
how many people heed this message and instead keep asking me all the time about 
the end of the world? We’ll “end” anyhow when we die! So we might just as well 
save our souls. Then if we want to save the world, we can contribute the supreme 
power. We have to get it back and use it; otherwise, who else is there to do 
this? The angels have their world and their duties to do; Jesus is teaching 
somewhere that’s more advanced than our Earth, and Buddha has gone to the 
Buddha’s Land to do His things. Only we are here to rescue ourselves. </p>
<p>So if you’re afraid of these disasters, get enlightenment. Repair the house, 
restore our world to a higher moral standard and enlighten our planet more. Then 
no disaster will befall us. Otherwise, even if I didn’t know anything about the 
future, I’d say, “Yes, anything could happen.” If the world were becoming so 
rotten a place that it wasn’t fit to live in, God would take it apart and create 
a new one. </p>

<h2><a name="qa5">Accroître notre trésor spirituel chaque jour, à chaque instant</a>
</h2>
<h3>Spoken by Supreme Master Ching Hai, Corée, March 22, 1992 (Originally in 
anglais) Videotape #233 </h3>
<p>Q: In these modern times, we go to work every day and at work it's difficult 
to meditate. So can we meditate during work? Is there some good method for this?
</p>
<p>M: Yes; whenever you have time, close your eyes and concentrate on the wisdom 
eye. That's meditation. Every minute and every second adds to your treasure. You 
can even meditate when you’re in the bathroom, or when you sit on the train, on 
the bus, in an airplane, in the park, in your bedroom before you sleep and when 
you first wake up. </p>
<p>Use your free time. Watch less television, spend less time on the telephone, 
look at fewer newspapers and you’ll have more time. And just do less talking. 
Sometimes we waste a lot of time drinking and talking nonsense with friends. If 
we recorded our conversations for a whole day, we’d see how useless they were: 
“The weather is fine; those clothes are beautiful; that car is the latest 
fashion.” These are all things that aren’t useful to developing our wisdom. </p>
<p>We shouldn’t talk when it's not necessary; we shouldn’t see people when it's 
not necessary. Then we’ll have more time for our wisdom training, more time to 
go within and know who we are. </p>

<h3>Spoken by Supreme Master Ching Hai, Budapest, Hungary, May 24, 1999 
(Originally in anglais) Videotape #652 </h3>
<p>Q: I'd like to ask whether Master can heal sick people. </p>
<p>M: I don’t do anything. I only let God do whatever Hes wants to whomever Hes 
chooses whenever Hes sees fit. There are people who claim to be healed by me, 
but the credit is God’s. I’m merely an instrument and God’s blessing flows 
through me to heal whomever Hes chooses to heal, but it happens. </p>

<h3>Spoken by Supreme Master Ching Hai, Budapest, Hungary, May 24, 1999 
(Originally in anglais) Videotape #652 </h3>
<p>Q: What does it mean if a small baby dies after several minutes or several 
hours of life, or if a person is born mentally disabled? </p>
<p>M: There are many ways a soul can choose to present itself in this world. God 
makes arrangements with that soul to do certain things, and we can’t understand 
them all. For example, in order to reach God a personalized soul sometimes 
chooses to be disabled. And sometimes to awaken love within the parents, a 
particular soul chooses to be born and to die shortly afterward. </p>
<p>God's arrangements are impossible to explain or to count with our fingers. 
But everything is for the best with regard to our spiritual development. </p>
